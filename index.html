				<p id="details">I have dogs myself, and I go on walks with them everyday in the countryside. All our dogs sleep indoors, so no one is left out, including yours!

Why does my service stand out...?

I live in the countryside, with a big garden, where there's loads of space for the dogs to run around and play.
I own dogs myself... So your dog will be socialised , and of course have tons of new playmates! Your dog will get to go on 3 hour nature walks everyday (2 walks a day) 
Our favourite places to walk are the forest and bog.

At the end of the day your dog will get to sleep inside, on a nice comfy couch, or bed, (whatever he prefers) Basically he will be busy having his own mini holiday, so no sad goodbyes!

I also offer pick up and drop off services,
and keep the owners updated by sending photos and videos every day.</p>

			Muirenn is absolutely fantastic, Romeo spent 3 days in her loving care and was in no hurry to greet us! He was very well cared for and made new friends. I highly recommend Muirenn she’s very sweet and a true animal lover. From the minute we met Muirenn, I knew Romeo was in very good hands. I will call on her anytime I need a sitter, Martine and Noel and of course Romeo.

			Otis has a great time at Muirenn’s, and I had a great time interacting with her. Otis got the chance to play with Muirenn’s other dogs, and make plenty of new friends. I also got daily photo updates, which is always appreciated! I’ll be back and I definitely recommend.

			Muirenn is a great dog sitter, she made Alfie feel at home. Brought him on regular walks in the woods, which he enjoyed very much. He also had loads of pets to play with, so he was never bored. I would highly recommend Muirenn.

			Muirenn hosted Bella (who is a shy big dog that very attached to me) for 7 days, and she made sure to send me photo updates of my dog every day which made me so happy and assured that my dog is happy and well treated. All the communication with Muirenn was very easy, also she is very flexible in terms of when to drop off and collect your dog, which I think is a great feature. She also provided nice long walks to my dog, and treated as her own.
